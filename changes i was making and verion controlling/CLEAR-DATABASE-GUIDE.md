## 🎯 SQL Script Explained

```sql
-- Shows you what you have before deletion
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM resources;

-- DELETES EVERYTHING
DELETE FROM resources;

-- Confirms everything is gone (should show 0)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM resources;
```

---

## 🔍 Verify Deletion

Run this in SQL Editor after deletion:

```sql
-- Check total resources
SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM resources;
-- Should return: 0

-- Check by program
SELECT program, COUNT(*) 
FROM resources 
GROUP BY program;
-- Should return: empty (no rows)
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### This is PERMANENT
- Cannot be undone
- No backup/restore
- All resources permanently deleted

### What to do BEFORE deletion:
- ✅ Make sure you want to delete everything
- ✅ No backup needed (starting fresh)
- ✅ Confirm with your team

### What to do AFTER deletion:
- ✅ Refresh your browser
- ✅ Upload new resources
- ✅ Duplicate prevention is still active
- ✅ System ready for clean uploads

---

## 🎨 Alternative: Delete Specific Program Only

If you want to delete only ONE program's resources:

```sql
-- Delete only Software Development
DELETE FROM resources WHERE program = 'Software Development';

-- Delete only Digital Marketing
DELETE FROM resources WHERE program = 'Digital Marketing';

-- Delete only Product Design
DELETE FROM resources WHERE program = 'Product Design';
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Nothing happened after running SQL"
- Check for error messages in SQL Editor
- Verify you're logged in to correct Supabase project
- Try running `SELECT * FROM resources` first to see data

### "Resources still showing in app"
- Hard refresh browser: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Clear browser cache
- Check if realtime subscription is active

### "Files still in storage"
- Go to Storage manually
- Select all files in resources bucket
- Delete them separately

## ✨ After Clearing

Your system will be:
- ✅ **Clean database** (0 resources)
- ✅ **Empty storage** (0 files)
- ✅ **Duplicate prevention active** (won't allow duplicates)
- ✅ **Success messages working** (clear feedback)
- ✅ **Ready for fresh uploads**
