## 🔍 How Duplicate Detection Works

### Checks Performed:
1. **Title match** (case-insensitive, trimmed spaces)
2. **Same program** (Software Dev, Digital Marketing, or Product Design)
3. **Not editing mode** (editing existing resources is allowed)

### Example Scenarios:

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Upload "React Basics" twice in same program | ❌ BLOCKED |
| Upload "React Basics" in different programs | ✅ ALLOWED |
| Upload "react basics" vs "React Basics" | ❌ BLOCKED (case-insensitive) |
| Upload " React Basics " with spaces | ❌ BLOCKED (trimmed) |
| Edit existing "React Basics" | ✅ ALLOWED (editing mode) |

## 📊 SQL Script Explained

The `remove-duplicates.sql` script does this:

```sql
1. Find all duplicate resources (same title + program)
2. Keep the NEWEST one (by created_at date)
3. Delete all older versions
4. Show you the final count
```

**Why keep the newest?**
- Latest upload is usually the most up-to-date version
- Preserves your most recent work
- Maintains correct file references

---

## ✅ After Running the Script

Your database will have:
- **NO duplicates** - each resource appears only once per program
- **All unique resources preserved**
- **Clean slate for future uploads**

Future uploads will be protected by the duplicate prevention system!

---

## 🚨 If You Still See Duplicates After

1. **Hard refresh your browser**: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. **Check different programs**: Each program can have a resource with the same name
3. **Verify SQL ran successfully**: Look for "Success" message in SQL Editor

---

## 📞 Need to Undo?

If you need to restore deleted duplicates, you can't (no undo). But you can:
- Re-upload the resource
- The new upload will have duplicate protection
- Won't create duplicates again

---

## ✨ You're Protected Now!

Once you run the script, you'll have:
- ✅ Clean database (no duplicates)
- ✅ Duplicate prevention active
- ✅ Clear success/error messages
- ✅ Button protection against double-clicks

**No more duplicates will be created!** 🎉
