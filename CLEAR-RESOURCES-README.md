## üìã SQL to Clear Specific Program

If you only want to delete resources from one program:

```sql
-- Delete only Software Development resources
DELETE FROM resources WHERE program = 'Software Development';

-- Delete only Digital Marketing resources
DELETE FROM resources WHERE program = 'Digital Marketing';

-- Delete only Product Design resources
DELETE FROM resources WHERE program = 'Product Design';
```

## üîç Verify Deletion

Run this in SQL Editor to check:

```sql
-- Count remaining resources
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_resources FROM resources;

-- Count by program
SELECT program, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM resources 
GROUP BY program;
```

Should return 0 if all resources are deleted.
